- 👋 Hi, I’m @HannahKLeBlanc
- 👀 I’m interested in health care, specifically primary care and women's health. I would like to go to PA school after I graduate from UT. I also love to bake and over quarnatine I created a baking page in order to spread some positivity and remind people that they were loved even if they were not physically present with the people they love. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate Python, GitHub and R. Coding is tricky for me, but I know it is an incredibly useful skill and it is always a fun challenge. I am also learning about vaccines in my immunology class, which is particularly relevant to out lives right now. In my history class, my professor has made it a point to focus on the lives and histories of minority and oppressed groups in United States history. As a class, we have tracked the movements and changes that have occurred in American society over the course of U.S. history and see how they have affected our society in the present. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with my peers in my statisitics class. 
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is best, h.leblanc@ymail.com
